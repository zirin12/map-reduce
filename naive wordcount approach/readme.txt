the file "brute.py" tries the naive wordcount approach
the file "search.py"&"wikisearch.py" is a test file which loads the json dictionary created and retrieves the word count for each word stored in the json file.
the file "dictcreate.py" opens the given data file and dumps the word and its url list into a json file for later testing.
